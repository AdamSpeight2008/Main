# Welcome

This is a github org, documentation and set of repos (currently just one) by and for the VB community!

## OSS from the VB Community

The following list are projects that are not only of interest/benefit to most VB developers, but are also primarily built in VB.  So if you are interested in getting more involved in open-source as a VB dev... check these out!

### [CSharpToVB (powered by 'Roslyn')](https://github.com/paul1956/CSharpToVB)

Paul has been working on a pretty incredible and completely free C# to VB conversion tool that is powered by the Roslyn API.  It is (as of this writing) seeing continued improvements on a very regular basis.  If you have a need to convert C# to VB... check this thing out!

### [Code Coverage](https://github.com/paul1956/Code-Coverage)

Using Visual Studio 2019 Community alongside unit testing?  Be sure to check out Paul's excellent utility to assist you in reviewing how well your tests are actually testing your code.

### [x8086NetEmu](https://github.com/morphx666/x8086NetEmu)

This is so cool that it has to be included it here!  Xavier has created a working 8086 emulator.  There are a few things that aren't 100% working; but, for the most part, it's working pretty much as well as other offerings in this space... and it's written in VB!

### [Community.VisualBasic (alternative to the Microsoft.VisualBasic library)](https://github.com/DualBrain/Community.VisualBasic)

Want to have all of the ease-of-use features that VB provides regardless of the project type and/or target operating system?  Enter [Community.VisualBasic](https://github.com/DualBrain/Community.VisualBasic), the *.netstandard 2.0* community driven alternative to the official Microsoft.VisualBasic "runtime".  

[Community.VisualBasic](https://github.com/DualBrain/Community.VisualBasic) Goals:

- Compatibility with Microsoft.VisualBasic namespace/functionality.  
- Cross-platform capability/compatibility.
- Slice and dice into smaller packages.
- Publish as separate nuget packages.
- Add additional functionality where appropriate.

See [Community.VisualBasic](https://github.com/DualBrain/Community.VisualBasic) for more details.

### [Vazor](https://github.com/VBAndCs/Vazor)

A VB Razor for ASP.NET Core 3.1 (MVC and Razor Pages). For .NET Core 2.2 version use.

### [VB to WebAssembly Compiler (Proof-of-Concept)](https://github.com/biocad-cloud/data.ts/releases/tag/v0.5.136-alpha)

Although not a much more than a proof-of-concept at this stage, it is a great start on creating an independent WebAssembly compiler for VB.

## OSS that is VB "Friendly"

The following projects ("pocket communities") that, although aren't built in or specificaly for VB, are generally positive toward the VB developer.

Note that some will have documentation/samples specifically for VB while others simply ensure that their projects work regardless of what development language utilizes them. 

- [NAudio - Audio and MIDI](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio)

## Resources

### [Code samples for VB.NET](https://github.com/karenpayneoregon/visual-basic-getting-started)

Karen has been working on moving her samples (collected over the years on, I believe, TechNet) to a repo here on github.  There's some really good stuff in here!

### [GotBASIC.com - VB7+](https://gotbasic.com/vb.html)

Cory has a website dedicated to BASIC with a section for VB v7+ with a lot of great resources.
